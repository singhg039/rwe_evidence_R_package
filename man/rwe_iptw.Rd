\title{Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting}
\usage{
rwe_iptw(
  data,
  ps_object = NULL,
  treatment = NULL,
  outcome = NULL,
  covariates = NULL,
  stabilized = TRUE,
  truncate = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Study cohort data (data frame or rwe_data object)}

\item{ps_object}{Optional rwe_propensity_score object (if NULL, estimates PS internally)}

\item{treatment}{Treatment variable name}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable name}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariate names (if ps_object is NULL)}

\item{stabilized}{Logical; use stabilized weights (recommended)}

\item{truncate}{Numeric vector of length 2 for weight truncation (e.g., c(0.01, 0.99))}
}
\value{
rwe_iptw object containing weights and balance assessment
}
\description{
Estimates treatment effects using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).
This method reweights observations to create pseudo-populations where treatment
assignment is independent of measured confounders.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# With existing propensity scores
iptw <- rwe_iptw(
  data = study_data,
  ps_object = ps_result,
  outcome = "survival_days"
)

# Estimate PS internally
iptw <- rwe_iptw(
  data = study_data,
  treatment = "treated",
  outcome = "survival_days",
  covariates = c("age", "sex", "comorbidities")
)
}
