}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Study cohort data (data frame or rwe_data object)}

\item{treatment}{Treatment variable name (binary: 0/1 or logical)}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariate variable names}

\item{method}{Estimation method: "logistic", "gbm", "random_forest",
"xgboost", "super_learner"}

\item{formula}{Optional custom formula (overrides treatment and covariates)}

\item{learner_control}{List of control parameters for learner algorithms}
}
\value{
rwe_propensity_score object containing model and scores
}
\description{
Estimates propensity scores for treatment assignment using various methods.
Propensity scores are used to balance treatment and control groups in
observational studies.
