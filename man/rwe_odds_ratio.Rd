\usage{
rwe_odds_ratio(
  data,
  outcome,
  treatment,
  confounders = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  confidence_level = 0.95,
  continuity_correction = 0.5,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame or rwe_data object containing the analysis data.}

\item{outcome}{Binary outcome variable name (1 = event, 0 = no event).}

\item{treatment}{Treatment variable name (typically binary: 1 = treated, 0 = control).}

\item{confounders}{Optional vector of confounder variable names for adjusted OR.}

\item{weights}{Optional weights (column name, numeric vector, or rwe_iptw object).}

\item{confidence_level}{Confidence level for CI (default: 0.95).}

\item{continuity_correction}{Value added to 2x2 table cells when zeros are present (default: 0.5).}

\item{quiet}{Logical; suppress console output (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
An rwe_odds_ratio object with estimates, confidence interval, and audit trail.
}
\description{
Computes the odds ratio (OR) comparing treatment outcomes between groups.
The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of an outcome in the exposed group
to the odds in the unexposed group.
