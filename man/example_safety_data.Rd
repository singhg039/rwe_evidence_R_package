\format{
A data frame with 120 rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
\item{subject_id}{Subject identifier (integer, some patients have multiple AEs)}
\item{ae_term}{Adverse event term (character)}
\item{ae_severity}{CTCAE grade (character: "Grade 1" through "Grade 4")}
\item{ae_serious}{Serious adverse event flag (character: "Yes", "No")}
\item{ae_related}{Relationship to treatment (character: "Yes", "No", "Possibly")}
\item{ae_onset_day}{Day of AE onset relative to treatment start (integer)}
\item{ae_resolved}{Resolution status (character: "Yes", "No", "Ongoing")}
\item{person_years}{Person-time at risk in years (numeric)}
\item{treatment_group}{Treatment group (character: "Control", "Treatment")}

\description{
A synthetic dataset of adverse events from 120 event records across
multiple patients. This dataset demonstrates safety surveillance and
pharmacovigilance workflows.
}
\details{
This dataset includes common adverse events and can be used to demonstrate:
\itemize{
\item Safety surveillance methods
\item Incidence rate calculations
\item Safety signal detection
\item Comparative safety analysis
\item Adverse event profiling
}

The \code{person_years} variable allows for proper incidence rate calculations
accounting for variable exposure time.

\strong{Note:} This is synthetic data generated for demonstration purposes only.
