\usage{
rwe_relative_risk(
  data,
  outcome,
  treatment,
  confounders = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  confidence_level = 0.95,
  continuity_correction = 0.5,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame or rwe_data object containing the analysis data.}

\item{outcome}{Binary outcome variable name (1 = event, 0 = no event).}

\item{treatment}{Treatment variable name (typically binary: 1 = treated, 0 = control).}

\item{confounders}{Optional vector of confounder variable names for adjusted RR.}

\item{weights}{Optional weights (column name, numeric vector, or rwe_iptw object).}

\item{confidence_level}{Confidence level for CI (default: 0.95).}

\item{continuity_correction}{Value added to 2x2 table cells when zeros are present (default: 0.5).}

\item{quiet}{Logical; suppress console output (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
An rwe_relative_risk object with estimates, confidence interval, and audit trail.
}
\description{
Computes the relative risk (RR) comparing treatment outcomes between groups.
The relative risk is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in the
exposed group to the probability in the unexposed group.
